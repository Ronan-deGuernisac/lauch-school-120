# Benefits of Object Oriented Programming in Ruby:
#
# 1. It keeps code DRY - i.e. if you have methods that you use a lot you can put them in a class or module
# 2. It keeps code contained which means that is easier to debug
#
# Launch School answers
# Creating objects allow programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
# Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
# It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
# It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
# We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
# As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
